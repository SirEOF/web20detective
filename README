WEB2.0 Detective is a small package of scripts for web application analysis.

It includes:

+module for finding the parameters, that the application handles.
+module for detection web-server software, testing for several configuration, dead code and information disclosure vulnerabilities
+script for grabbing the dictionary for Arguments Finder module
+sample dictionary, made by args_grabber.php
+module for searching (temporary) file copies, left, for example, by various text editors

Currently, there're tests for typical Apache, NginX, Microsoft-IIS, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails issues or vulnerabilities.
One of the main advantages of this tool is a small number of requests sent to the server.
BTW, system requirements: Python 3.
You can find more information in docs.html in the release.
